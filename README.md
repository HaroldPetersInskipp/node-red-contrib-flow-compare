# FlowCompare

FlowCompare node is a node for visually comparing the editor flows with flows deployed to the server.

Flows are deployed from the editor to the server, hence they can differ. This node highlights changes that have occurred in the editor.

## Why?

I wanted to have a *visual* comparison between versions of flows. Also I wanted changes to be classified as being either visual or textual: visual changes movements of nodes, textual are content changes.
